## Description

This application allows you to use a terminal-like text editor in your browser and as a app. The purpose of making this app was to create a custom text editor in the form of a progressive web app (pwa). This app was built with node.js, express, babel, and webpack. The reason why I built this text editor was to create a progressive web app. I learned how to create a pwa using webpack and babel in conjunction with node.
